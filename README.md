# 911-Call-Data-Visualization
Carried out Data Visualization on 911 Calls Dataset
**911 Calls Data Visualization**

**Introduction:**
This project aims to visualize and analyze emergency 911 call data to gain insights into the types of emergencies, their locations, and patterns over time. The data used for this visualization was collected from emergency call centers and includes information such as the type of emergency, location coordinates, date, and time of the call.


**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

**Data Preprocessing:**
Before creating the visualizations, the raw data underwent preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. This included handling missing or inconsistent data, converting date and time strings to appropriate formats, and aggregating the data as needed for visualization.

**Visualizations:**

1. **Emergency Type Distribution:**
   A bar chart depicting the distribution of different emergency types (e.g., Medical, Traffic, Fire) to understand which type occurs most frequently.

2. **Geographical Heatmap:**
   A heatmap or choropleth map displaying the geographic distribution of 911 calls, allowing us to identify areas with high emergency call volumes.

3. **Emergency Calls Over Time:**
   A line plot or time series chart illustrating the number of emergency calls over time (daily, weekly, or monthly) to identify any trends or seasonal variations.

4. **Hourly Emergency Call Distribution:**
   A line chart or bar plot showing the number of emergency calls received during different hours of the day, revealing peak call times.

5. **Emergency Type by Location:**
   A scatter plot or bubble chart with location markers representing different emergency types, providing insights into the spatial distribution of emergencies.

6. **Emergency Call Trends by Category:**
   A stacked area chart showcasing the trends of emergency calls over time for each category (e.g., medical, traffic, fire) to compare their relative volumes.

**Conclusion:**
Through these visualizations, we aim to gain valuable insights into the patterns and characteristics of 911 emergency calls. This information can be used by emergency services and policymakers to optimize resource allocation and response strategies.

**Usage:**
To reproduce these visualizations, ensure you have the required libraries installed and run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

**Disclaimer:**
The data used in this visualization is for educational and informational purposes only. Any personal or sensitive information has been anonymized and should not be used for real-world emergency response decision-making.
